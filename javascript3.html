        <h1 align="center">FOR LOOP</h1>
    In JavaScript, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, based on a condition or a fixed number of times. There are several types of loops available in JavaScript:
    
for loop: The for loop is used when you know the number of times you want to execute a block of code. The syntax of a for loop is as follows:
css




for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code to be executed
}




Here, initialization is the initial value of the variable, condition is the condition to be checked before each iteration, and increment/decrement is the operation to be performed after each iteration.
    </div>

    <div class="contain1" style=" border: 2px solid black; margin-bottom: 22px"  >

        <h1 align="center">WHILE LOOP</h1>
    
    while loop: The while loop is used when you do not know the number of times you want to execute a block of code. The syntax of a while loop is as follows:
javascript



while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}



Here, condition is the condition to be checked before each iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition is true.

        <h1 align="center">DO WHILE LOOP</h1>
        do...while loop: The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is false. The syntax of a do...while loop is as follows:


        do {
            // code to be executed
          } while (condition);


     style=" border: 2px solid black; margin-bottom: 22px"        
        </div>
